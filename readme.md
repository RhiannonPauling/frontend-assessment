Before undertaking these exercises, I forked the branch and then got myself reasonably familiar with Bootstrap to learn on the fly (a lot of the styling in exercise 1 is mixed with normal CSS and Bootstrap), hence why my submission is late. I dedicated the time allocated plus a little more but however did not get to bonus styling etc.
Sorry!


Exercise 1 - assessment folder

- Download and open folder

Exercise 2 - assessment-2 folder

* Explain why the result of `('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()` is `banana`.

- The + + is an invalid expression which returns NaN (not a number) and then the whole string is coverted to lowercase hence the 'nan'.
